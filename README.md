# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

This project is an exercise in using third party javascript APIs and interacting with the html & css using those APIs.

The project involves the creation of a time-scheduling application where events can be entered and saved in 1-hour blocks between normal business hours of 9AM to 5PM.
The application will cross-check the system time with the time blocks scheduled and color code blocks based on whether that time was in the past, is in the present, or is in the future.
Saved information persists across page refreshes.

A link to the deployed application can be located at: https://danqest.github.io/05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler/
